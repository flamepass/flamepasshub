# Flamepass

Flamepass is an unblocked gaming platform designed for school or office users who are restricted from certain websites. Its goal is to bring users freedom while also protecting their privacy against activity monitoring. It has now archived more than 3500 HTML5, Flash, DOS and classic games, plus additional tools like **unblockers**, **emulators**, **unblocked YouTube** and **unblocked ChatGPT**. 

## Features
- **3500+ Free Unblocked Games** - This is what makes NettleWeb the largest unblocked website on GitHub, most of them are stored locally meaning they are not affected by network restrictions.
- **Dynamic Server Switching** - You can create and use your own [Backend Mirror](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qh4VDIIYyi37f4nYaUqEiYd-CbI7dN6Bsaoy0X4hsQ0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5hlrywvf3ho5) in case the default backend server is blocked by network restrictions.
- **Unblocked YouTube** - A standalone, ad-less YouTube client is included in the 'apps' section.
- **Unblocked ChatGPT** - A standalone, unlimited, self-hosted ChatGPT is included in the 'chat' section.
- **Unblocker/Proxy** - Allows you to access 99% of the blocked websites, regardless they are blocked by network or extensions. Multiple unblocking modes are included, you can switch mode in case some websites don't work properly.
- **Chat Features** - This is what makes NettleWeb different from other unblocked websites. We have included an embedded chat application that allows you to send realtime direct messages with your friends.
